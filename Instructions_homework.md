## OO Weekend Homework
###Requirements

Apply all the learning of the last two weeks to produce a TDD OO-designed application that models the operations of a hotel.

Single Hotel

1. We're going to need to model individual hotels, and their rooms -- they can have single or double-rooms. The hotel shold be able to tell us it's capacity. Rooms need to have a daily rate.

2. We also need guests. Guests need to be able check in to rooms at the hotel, and check out at the end of their stays.

4. Ensure we don't double-book rooms, or over-fill hotels.

5. The management are going to need reporting on the occupancy, and the revenue for a particular hotel (this can just be a running total don't worry about dates).

Further

* We've gone big time and have multiple hotels.  We need occupancy reporting across all our hotels.
